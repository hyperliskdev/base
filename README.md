# base
A rust robotics implementation built on embedded_hal




### Idea

The basic idea for this project is to provide a library and utilities for constructing mostly any type of robotics.


From the hal crates, I want to abstract functionality like motor control, sensor data. Input and Output for control and possibly some math tools.
